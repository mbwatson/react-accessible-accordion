> Accessible accordion component for React

Accordion to Accordion Design Pattern in WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1,
https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/accordion/accordion.html,
accessible accordions have the following required keyboard support:

- ðŸ”‘ SPACE & ENTER:
    + When focus is on the accordion header of a collapsed section, expands the section.
- ðŸ”‘ TAB:
    + Moves focus to the next focusable element.
    + All focusable elements in the accordion are included in the page Tab sequence.
- ðŸ”‘ SHIFT + TAB:
    + Moves focus to the previous focusable element.
    + All focusable elements in the accordion are included in the page Tab sequence.
- ðŸ”‘ DOWN ARROW:
    + When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the next accordion header.
    + When focus is on last accordion header, moves focus to first accordion header.
- ðŸ”‘ UP ARROW:
    + When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the previous accordion header.
    + When focus is on first accordion header, moves focus to last accordion header.
- ðŸ”‘ HOME:
    + When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the first accordion header.
- ðŸ”‘ END:
    + When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the last accordion header.

This accordion component satisfies the above requirements and thus is fully accessible. The package depends [React](https://reactjs.org/). Prior to version 1.1.0, [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) was a dependency.

## Install

```bash
npm i react-accessible-accordion
```

## Usage

Use the `Accordion` component to wrap `Panel` components. Children of `Accordion` must be `Panel` components and their `id`s must be unique.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { Accordion, Panel } from 'react-accessible-accordion'

class Example extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <main>
        
        <h1>React Accessible Accordion</h1>

        <Accordion>
          <Panel title="Lorem ipsum." id="lorem-ipsum">
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quod, quas nostrum facere non nobis.</p>
            <p>Tenetur odit incidunt quae deserunt quisquam, deleniti at maxime.</p>
          </Panel>
          <Panel title="Lorem ipsum dolor." id="lorem-ipsum-dolor">
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quibusdam nostrum nesciunt velit labore, iste quae et possimus veritatis error numquam quasi vel eos.</p>
          </Panel>
          <Panel title="Lorem ipsum sit amet." id="lorem-ipsum-sit-amet">
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur pariatur, expedita quos eaque deserunt facere reiciendis eligendi voluptatum asperiores, ullam voluptates! Officia numquam ea provident est, facere non repudiandae, sunt. Accusamus praesentium id quibusdam suscipit eius distinctio reprehenderit libero possimus a optio culpa aut quis quae, ipsa ratione nobis facere!</p>
          </Panel>
        </Accordion>

      </main>
    )
  }
}
```

### Custom Styling

The root `Accordion` component takes an object for the `styles` prop, whose properties will be distributed to the appropriate parts of the `Panel` component. See the example below. This lets the developer pass in styling overrides to the panel to style the panel headers, titles, and bodies. Each panel receives the same styling.

```jsx
  const panelStyles = {
    header: {
      backgroundColor: 'beige',
      border: '1px solid darkcyan',
    },
    title: {
      color: 'darkslategray',
      fontSize: '14pt',
      letterSpacing: '2px',
    },
    body: {
      borderWidth: '0 1px 1px 1px',
      borderStyle: 'solid',
      borderColor: 'darkcyan',
      padding: '1rem',
      background: 'linear-gradient(160deg, white, aliceblue)',
    },
  }

  //...

  <Accordion styes={ panelStyles }>
    <Panel id="some-unique-id" title="Lorem ipsum." >
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quod, quas nostrum facere non nobis.</p>
      <p>Tenetur odit incidunt quae deserunt quisquam, deleniti at.</p>
    </Panel>

    //...

  </Accordion>

  //...
```

## Contribute

### Linking

During development of the accordion component, we want the example app to use our local copy so we can see changes reflected as they are made. In addition, we want both the `react-accessible-accordion` _and_ the example app to use the same installation of React so there are no conflicts.

An example lives in the `./example` directory. This is a React application bootsrapped with `create-react-app`. To develop, we'll need to link the example to the project source.

First, execute

```bash
sudo npm link
```

from the project root, then

```bash
npm link ../
```

within the `./example` directory.

This tells the example React app to use the local version of `react-accessible-accordion` instead of requiring an installation from npm. 

Also link the `react-accessible-accordion` to the example app's version of React with

```bash
npm link ./example/node_modules/react/
```

in the project root.

### Development

Spin up the example app's development server with

```bash
npm start
```

from the `./example` directory. Now develop the `react-accessible-accordion` package as needed, and rebuild it with `npm run build` from the project root to see the changes reflected in the example app.
