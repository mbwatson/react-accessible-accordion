    + ‚≠ê All focusable elements in the accordion are included in the page Tab sequence.
- üîë SHIFT + TAB:
    + ‚≠ê Moves focus to the previous focusable element.
    + ‚≠ê All focusable elements in the accordion are included in the page Tab sequence.
- üîë DOWN ARROW:
    + ‚≠ê When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the next accordion header.
    + ‚≠ê When focus is on last accordion header, moves focus to first accordion header.
- üîë UP ARROW:
    + ‚≠ê When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the previous accordion header.
    + ‚≠ê When focus is on first accordion header, moves focus to last accordion header.

- üîë END:

This accordion component is fully accessible and animated. The package uses and thus depends on [React](https://reactjs.org/, of course, and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

## Install

```bash
npm i react-accessible-accordion
```

## Usage

Use the `Accordion` component to wrap `Panel` components. Children of `Accordion` must be `Panel` components--just supply unique `id`s of the `Panel` components.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { Accordion, Panel } from 'react-accessible-accordion'

class Example extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <main>
        
        <h1>React Accessible Accordion</h1>

        <Accordion>
          <Panel title="Lorem ipsum." id="lorem-ipsum">
            <div>
              <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quod, quas nostrum facere non nobis tenetur odit incidunt quae deserunt quisquam, deleniti at maxime.</p>
            </div>
          </Panel>
          <Panel title="Lorem ipsum dolor." id="lorem-ipsum-dolor">
            <div>
              <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quibusdam nostrum nesciunt velit labore, iste quae et possimus veritatis error numquam quasi vel eos.</p>
            </div>
          </Panel>
          <Panel title="Lorem ipsum sit amet." id="lorem-ipsum-sit-amet">
            <div>
              <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur pariatur, expedita quos eaque deserunt facere reiciendis eligendi voluptatum asperiores, ullam voluptates! Officia numquam ea provident est, facere non repudiandae, sunt. Accusamus praesentium id quibusdam suscipit eius distinctio reprehenderit libero possimus a optio culpa aut quis quae, ipsa ratione nobis facere!</p>
            </div>
          </Panel>
        </Accordion>

      </main>
    )
  }
}
```
